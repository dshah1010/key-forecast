# Technology 
Python and Django are used to develop the backend of this web application where POST requests are sent to the OpenWeatherMap API and weather data is retrieved. GET requests enable when the city name is typed and searched through the API data. HTML and CSS are used for the basic front end development and JSON loads in the data requested from the API. 

# Usage

If you would like to download my project, these are the steps:
        <ol>
        <li>
          Go to the directory you want in your command line and write:
          ```
          git clone https://github.com/dshah1010/listify.git
          ```
       </li>
       <li>
          Open Google Chrome. 
       </li>
       <li>
          Click on the extensions icon in the top right. 
       </li>
       <li> 
          Click "Manage extensions". 
       </li>
       <li>
          Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right. 
       </li>
       <li>
          Click "Load unpacked" in the top left and choose the directory of the cloned project. 
       </li>
       <li>
          The extension is now part of your browser and you have the option to pin and use it. 
       </li>
       <li>
          If you want to make any changes to it, simply edit the files, save them, and reload the browser/extension. 
       </li>
       </ol>
       
# What's Next?
In the future, I plan to upgrade the UI and include features such as being able to save certain city weather locations of your choice to view at any time. I can also make it more interactive by having the map of the world and when a particular area is clicked, the program knows the location and automatically displays the information retrieved from the API.
